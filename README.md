This program aids in preparing books for shupment from a book depot.

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) of a book is a series of digits that uniquely identifies a book. The rightmost digit is called the *checksum* and is computed from the other digits. If the computed checksum does not match the one indicated on the book's label, it is considered damaged and invalid.

## Features
- Calculate the checksum of a book based on its ISBN.
- Check if the ISBN of a book corresponds to its checksum.
- Computes the maximum number of copies of a book that can fit into a box of given dimensions.
- Displays a menu that allows the user to choose which action is to be performed.
